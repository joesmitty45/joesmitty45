Hello, my name is "Joe Smith". Joe Smith is a pseudonym of an eccentric teenager that loves reading, writing, coding, sports, and talking in third person. Joe is going through TOP, or The Odin Project, and is very interested in learning both sides of web design, front-end and back-end. Joe also wants to have friends, but Joe does not know what is good for him. Joe might also think of writing books on GitHub, because that'd be really weird. Joe wishes you all a good day.
